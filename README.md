# MazeCreator
Creates a no left turns maze


I tried so hard. I will be continuing to work on it.

The idea is that there is a random maze generated around the right size for the level and a good amount of solutions available to work with. Then I alter the maze by adding a wall to block the most amount of unoptimal solutions possible wihtout blocking all the valid solutions. Continue to do so until only one solution remains(this is where I got stuck).

Currently hardcoded for a level easy/a blank maze for testing purposes.
